# Direct Instance Variable Modification in Ruby

This repository showcases a common but subtle issue in Ruby: directly manipulating instance variables using `instance_variable_set` and `instance_variable_get`. While this approach works, it can lead to maintenance problems and unexpected behavior.

The `bug.rb` file illustrates this by modifying the `@value` instance variable directly, bypassing any established getter or setter methods.  This can make code harder to understand, debug, and maintain, especially in larger projects.

The `bugSolution.rb` file demonstrates a better approach, emphasizing the use of accessor methods (`attr_accessor`, `attr_reader`, `attr_writer`) for managing instance variables.  This promotes encapsulation, improves code readability, and simplifies future modifications.
